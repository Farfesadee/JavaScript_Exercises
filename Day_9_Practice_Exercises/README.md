# Below are the Practice Questions for JavaScript Day 9: Asynchronous JavaScript


## 🎯 Practice Exercise 1
Task: Tell a delayed joke with Promises. 
 
- Write a function `tellJoke()` that returns a Promise.  
- After 3 seconds, resolve with `"😂 Here’s a funny joke!"`.  
- Test it using `.then()`.  


## 🎯 Practice Exercise 2
Task: Random delivery success or failure.  
- Write a function `deliverOrder(order)` that waits 2 seconds.  
- 50% of the time, resolve with `"✅ Delivered: <order>"`.  
- 50% of the time, reject with `"❌ Delivery failed: <order>"`.  
- Use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle both cases.


## 🎯 Practice Exercise 3
